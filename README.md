## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Senior Data Scientist** at **Target** who loves turning messy data into clean insights (and occasionally turning coffee into code ☕). I specialize in **Retail Analytics**, **Time Series Forecasting**, and building **Agentic AI** systems that actually work in production.

When I'm not optimizing planograms or training models, you can find me analyzing stock charts, building my dream PC rig, or re-watching *Silicon Valley*
